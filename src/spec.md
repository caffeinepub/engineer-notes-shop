# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Provide an in-app way for users to clearly specify and share what they want updated.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a visible “Request an update” action in the main layout (header or footer).
- Implement a modal opened by this action with a multiline text input, a “Copy to clipboard” button, and a “Close” button.
- Add toast feedback for clipboard copy success and failure, with all user-facing text in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a “Request an update” modal, type update instructions, copy them to the clipboard, and see a success/error toast.
