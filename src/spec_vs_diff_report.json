  "summary": "The diff implements a tokenless “claim store ownership” backend method with a corresponding frontend /admin CTA and React Query hooks/keys for claimability + post-claim invalidation. A migration file was added to preserve state across upgrades. No clear unimplemented BuildRequest requirements are evident from the provided diff summary, but a couple of unrelated UI tweaks appear to have been included.",
