  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements: backend admin logic fixes with auto-initialization, persistence via migration module, and removal of the 'Initialize as Owner' button. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed through backend changes (auto-initialization, migration), frontend UI updates (removed button, updated messaging), and diagnostic improvements.",

      "description": "Manual initialization functionality via initializeStore button",
      "reason": "REQ-3 specifies to 'remove or fix the Initialize as Owner button' and clarifies that 'auto-initialization should handle owner assignment automatically'. The diff adds an initializeStore mutation and includes references to 'onRetryInitialization' in AdminUploadsTroubleshootingHint.tsx and initialization button handling in AdminDashboardPage.tsx. While REQ-3 allows keeping the button if it 'properly triggers backend initialization', the BuildRequest constraints and non-goals emphasize preserving single-actor architecture without adding new initialization flows beyond the auto-initialization already specified in REQ-2.",
