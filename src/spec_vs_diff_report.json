  "summary": "The diff implements automatic owner assignment on first authenticated user access, removes the 'Initialize as Owner' button, and adds a migration module to handle state changes. All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear to be addressed through the autoInitializeIfNeeded() function and removal of manual initialization UI.",

    {
      "description": "Migration module added (backend/migration.mo) to handle state schema changes",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not mention adding migration functionality or changing the backend state schema. The migration removes ownerEmail and ownerPrincipal fields that were not part of the requirements.",
